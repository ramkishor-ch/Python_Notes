Collections
The collections module in Python implements specialized container datatypes providing alternatives to Python’s general purpose built-in containers, dict, list, set, and tuple.
The following tools exist:

namedtuple : factory function for creating tuple subclasses with named fields
OrderedDict : dict subclass that remembers the order entries were added
Counter : dict subclass for counting hashable objects
defaultdict : dict subclass that calls a factory function to supply missing values
deque : list-like container with fast appends and pops on either end
In Python 3 some more modules exist (ChainMap, UserDict, UserList, UserString). See https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html for further references.

# namedtuples are easy to create, lightweight object types.

# They can be used wherever regular tuples are used, and they add the ability to access fields by name instead of position index.

# OrderedDict :
# OrderedDicts are just like regular dictionaries but they remember the order that items were inserted. 
# When iterating over an ordered dictionary, the items are returned in the order their keys were first added. 
# If a new entry overwrites an existing entry, the original insertion position is left unchanged. 
# They have become less important now that the built-in dict class gained the ability to remember insertion order (guaranteed since Python 3.7). 
# But some differences still remain, e.g. the OrderedDict is designed to be good at reordering operations.

# A deque is a double-ended queue. It can be used to add or remove elements from both ends. 
# Deques support thread safe, memory efficient appends and pops from either side of the deque with approximately

# where the inputs and outputs are restricted to a single end.
